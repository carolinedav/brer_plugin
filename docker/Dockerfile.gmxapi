# This Dockerfile is used to produce a working installation of gmxpy and libgmxapi
# against which to develop plugins. The sample plugin is also built, but not installed.
# These dependencies are currently in private repositories, so they should be
# retrieved before building the docker image so that the sources are available in
# the same directory as the Dockerfile as 'gromacs-gmxapi' and 'gmxpy'.
#
#     # Get this repository and this Dockerfile
#     mkdir docker-build-dir
#     cd docker-build-dir
#     git clone git@bitbucket.org:kassonlab/samplerestraint.git
#     cp samplerestraint/Dockerfile ./
#
#     # Get the dependencies
#     git clone git@bitbucket.org:kassonlab/gromacs_api.git gromacs-gmxapi
#     (cd gromacs-gmxapi && git checkout develop-0.0.3)
#     git clone git@bitbucket.org:kassonlab/gmxpy-dev.git gmxpy
#
#     # Build the image with this Dockerfile
#     docker build . -f Dockerfile.gmxapi -t gmxapi
#
#     # Build another image with gmxpy as well
#     docker build . -t plugintest
